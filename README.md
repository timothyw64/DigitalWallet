Digital Wallet App
==================

Dependancy
------------------
- MongoDB 4.0.5 (https://www.mongodb.com)

Quick Start
------------------

```bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/timothyw64/DigitalWallet

# Go to the directory
cd DigitalWallet

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Execute Unit test
npm test

# Start REST server
npm run server

# Start WEB server
npm run client

```

Additional Info
-----------------
Normally the Javascript files generated by the Dustjs compiler would not be checked into the git repository.. This is
done in order to allow client to the executed with requiring the 'grunt' task to be performed as part of the 
'Quick start'.

Developer notes
------------------

The client application uses Dustjs templating (.dust) which needs to be compiled to 
Javascript file(s). In order to compile the dust file(s), the 'grunt' command must be executed in the project's root directory. Additionally, you can use the 'watcher' task within the Gruntfile to automatically compile dust file(s) as they change.

```bash

# Compile dust file(s)
grunt dev

# Start dust file watcher
grunt watcher

```

NOTE: This assume the 'grunt' command has been installed globally (npm install grunt -g).
